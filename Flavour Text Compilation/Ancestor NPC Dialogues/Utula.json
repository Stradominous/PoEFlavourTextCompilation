Problem is, there's some sort of witchery surrounding the place. Only those who 'see the truth with faithful eyes' are getting in there. The power of Innocence... it's all in the eyes, you see. Yet blessed Kitava has answered my prayers and sent us just the pair of eyes we need. The ever faithful Justicar Casticus. He's there in the Control Blocks right now, smiting my people with self righteous fury.  Find him, and rip his faithful eyes out.

The arse end, that's the Chamber of Innocence. It's where the real earnest believing gets done. Where the young Templar go to pay their respects to God almighty and get the good sense baptised out of their heads. I've not seen inside the chamber myself, but you can feel it from over a block away. Like there's an eye in your gut, peering through your insides, looking for even the tiniest stain of Sin.
