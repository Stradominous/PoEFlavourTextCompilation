I grew up in a time of turmoil and nightmare in the wake of the Cataclysm that destroyed the Eternals. Because she once helped put the men in power who likely caused it, my mother taught me that war is not the glorious endeavour our Way makes it out to be. All she wanted, by the end, was peace.

At that time, the Sun was no brighter than any other star, and it was verdant green. Sione, however, was the most ambitious of the gods. She traded away all of her tribe's possessions to foreign cultures in exchange for gold, and she plated her entire palace with that useless but shiny material. Her tribe was on the verge of starvation, but she asked them to trust her. They put on a festival with what little they had left, and to this, Ramako was invited. In awe of the supposed wealth of Sione, Ramako accepted her invitation to go through the traditions together. Once he entered her golden palace, his light reflected countless times, blazing warmth and life all over the world. Sione's palace cyclically rose above the world, then back into it, and while it was in the sky, that time became known as Day. To her credit, this shining beacon drew food, wealth, and respect to her tribe. Her gambit paid off. Ramako became the Father of the Sun ever after."

This greatly irritated Sione, but there was nothing she could do. He was family! Her own sister often caused such disruptions already when that silver palace neared hers, and now Ramako's brother would interfere as well. She resolved to hold family gatherings as little as possible. That is why eclipses only happen every few years. The two sisters put aside their eternal war for a brief time to satisfy their traditional familial obligations. Even the gods must follow the Way. "

There is a tale, very rarely told, of a deceiver being caught and locked away for this crime. Supposedly, it was the ancient elders of my tribe that enacted this justice. We consider the matter settled, but Sione and Lani Hua continue to battle for eternity in distant realms... they do not listen to us. They do not listen to anyone. All they care about is vengeance.

However, his greater strength kept me on the defensive. Every hour, the hatungo called a truce, and we drank, ate, and were tended to. By nightfall, Kaom and I were moving like turtles, guarding ourselves behind our axes and taking only the most calculated movements. Eventually, he overextended again, and I dealt him a heavy wound to his chestbut this was an acceptable sacrifice he had made on purpose. He broke my knee with the end of his axe handle, and that was it. He gave me a warrior's death, rather than leave me broken on the sands. I would not have had it any other way."

Our hatungo speaks of a time when all Ngakuramakoi will become so strong, and so skilled at warfare, that every man and woman will seek to become their own chieftain. Blood lust will take over the people, and war will continue until only one warrior remains. That warrior will be the strongest that ever lived in all of history, and he will die soon after from his wounds. His fallen body will become the new world, and his blood, the rivers. His dying warcry will become the sky, and his fierce eyes will become the new Sun and Moon. Of course, this is not a literal tale. It is meant to give us a sense of place in a chaotic existence. There is immense value in this. Our traditions give us meaning and purpose, that is why I have dedicated my lifeand my deathto upholding them. Otherwise, we would be adrift, and full of fear."

When tending the dying, she gave them visions of their family, until the spirits of their Ancestors truly greeted them here in the Halls of the Dead. These are acts of mercy and kindness, but they are not powers of the Sun or the Moon. I have long suspected that there is something within each of us, some pattern or essence of who we are, that each parent passes down to a child. If my suspicion is correct, then it is not possible that Ramako is Arohongui's father.

Those warrior souls cry out in fear and torment as they lay in hospice. They speak not of war with Sione, but of a war with the stars themselves. They have been sworn to silence by both Sione and Lani Hua, but the feverish ones cannot help but rant. Apparently, the two sisters did go out into the night sky to wage war upon one another, but when they got there, they encountered something horrible, something that drives even the strongest warrior to madness and panic. We have not been abandoned by our two strongest gods. They are out there protecting us every single minute of every single day, and they cannot rest for even a moment.

I will participate in the battles because I enjoy fighting, but this is their culture. They seem unaware that I do not intend to fit their expectations. My heart warms for no one. I do not know what love is, only that it motivates others to act like fools and monsters, depending on their inclinations. Perhaps I do have a frozen heart, but that doesn't mean I feel nothing. Their words still hurt me, perhaps even more than their weapons."

The Moon, in the sky above, follows a roughly oval path around us. Did you know that our world is actually shaped like the Moon? Most believe that Wraeclast is flat, because that is the obvious interpretation of what we see. However, in studying the Moon, my tribe has discovered the truth. Also, we realised that the Moon's path is not exact. Over many, many thousands of years, it is changing slightly... toward us. We have come to understand that the world will end when the Moon comes too close and falls upon us. This is not myth. This is knowledge. What else could possibly happen when two such titanic spheres of stone crash into each other?"

In life, I followed these questions to the heart of the pattern, and it took me to a vast lake... but I do not remember what I found there..."

Then, the first of a new line of Karui will emerge from the molten caldera, as we did before. They will be different. Maybe better, in some sense, having learned from the wisdom our souls will carry forward. Theirs will be a savage new world to conquer all over again.

Ramako goes to our Father of Night, Rongokurai, and asks for the cover of darkness to secretly visit Lani Hua without his wife knowing. Poor Rongo, being a good brother, obliges. Ramako visits Lani Hua many times, until... as happens with such things... Arohongui is born. Sione becomes furious, as you can imagine. The Sun becomes so bright, fire scorches the world...  My tribe survives that fire easily because we tend to live in caves, but Lani Hua, being a natural healer, steps in to preserve the rest of the Karui. Sione goes to war against her, and she and Lani Hua have been fighting ever since. Now, Ramako lives alone in his golden palace, and Arohongui tends wounded souls in the silver palace of the Moon, taking care of it in her mother's absence. The most absurd part? Ramako claims it wasn't him! He calls his brother a liar, and now Ramako and Rongo don't speak. The Day and the Night are forever avoiding each other because the Father of the Sun couldn't keep his belt tied on... fortunately, we Karui are much more mature and responsible in modern times."

The gods were asleep. So, I appointed myself the Herald of War, and I used the power of Valako's Sign to win many great battles.

We Karui are a nomadic people, in the physical and spiritual sense. When I call my tribe the Valako tribe, yes, we are, but at one time we followed Tukohama, and at another Tasalio, and then Valako again before that. Essentially, each god must prove themselves to us the same way we prove ourselves to each other. If a tribe falls on hard times, clearly, their god has failed them, and it may be time for another. We can also call upon any god we wish at any time, so long as we are in good standing as a warrior. Basically, it's like children running amok around the campfire."

Corruption has a tendency to make Karui sick with a kind of... blood fever. That is the true reason our Way forbids the use of Tears of Maji. During my life, a handful of Karui tried to implant them in their flesh. They became filled with rage and unnatural strength, and we had to put them down... then burn their bodies. Their mere proximity made others sick, too, so for every warrior that transgressed, five others gave their lives to protect the rest of us. To wipe us out, the Vaal could have simply spread the blood fever. My peacemaking, concessions, and treaties were born of that vulnerability, and I am glad I forged such a path. The Vaal Empire eventually succumbed to its own disease, and we remained."

Once they were dead, knowing that more would come if we had what they wanted, I entrusted Tasalio with our piece of that fabled spear. My tribe tried to put me in charge after that, but I refused the mantle. I just did what I thought was right, and they followed.<br> <br> Although... there was something to the myth of that spear's power.

When they say I have an unconventional fighting style, it is because they do not realize that I am not fighting. I am dancing.

Eventually, a vast forest emerged around them. Tawhoa opened his eyes and asked if the traveler understood. He replied that he did, save for one thing: some seeds fell, but never grew at all. At this, Tawhoa looked past him. Hinekora was walking the same path. She picked up each seed that never became more, and carried them, with love, in a bowl formed from her dress.

Yet blessed Kitava has answered my prayers and sent us just the pair of eyes we need. The ever faithful Justicar Casticus. He's there in the Control Blocks right now, smiting my people with self righteous fury.  Find him, and rip his faithful eyes out. Then I'm sure the good Justicar will be kind enough to 'see' you into the Templar Courts."

He's over at the Chamber of Innocence, beyond the Templar Courts, and I bet he's just dying to meet you. It's High Templar Avarius I'm talking about, although he's so filled to the eyeballs with Innocence that it's hard to tell where the man ends and the god begins these days. That's good news for us. Kill the man and you kill the god. And what are the Templar without their god? Lambs in a slaughterhouse."

Not that he was the only one. Captain Sigmund Fairgraves funded many an expedition off the whipped backs of Karui children. High Templar Dominus was only the latest in a long line of men to grow rich by trading in misery. Oriathan wealth was built on Karui poverty.

The arse end, that's the Chamber of Innocence. It's where the real earnest believing gets done. Where the young Templar go to pay their respects to God almighty and get the good sense baptised out of their heads. I've not seen inside the chamber myself, but you can feel it from over a block away. Like there's an eye in your gut, peering through your insides, looking for even the tiniest stain of Sin. I tell you, sane people go in one end of that place, ash and apostles come out the other. Watch yourself in there."

It was on his orders that men, women and children were shackled and shipped like cattle to Theopolis.
