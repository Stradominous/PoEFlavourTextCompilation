It is easy to be Karui when you are surrounded by Karui, but to walk the Karui Way through this accursed land, that is the true test of a warrior. \r\n\r\nAnd as is our fate, our calling demands our sweat and our blood, every moment of every day.

By absorbing some heavy losses and feigning a chaotic retreat, Kaom drew Marceus into ordering his Gemlings to abandon their tower shields so that they might pursue and rout the fleeing Karui. \r\n\r\nIt was not out of recklessness that Lioneye plucked such a decision, but from the experience-born confidence that the Karui did not have archers. Traditionally, Karui warriors are forbidden from using projectile weapons of any kind. What Lioneye understandably overlooked was that this tavukai (sacred prohibition) did not extend to women. At her uncle's behest, Hyrri had traveled to Thebrus and studied archery with Voll's finest military tutors. When the legionnaires shed protection in favour of mobility, Hyrri and her bow-women broke cover and rained death upon the Gemlings from the cliffs above.\r\n\r\nA valiant Marceus Lioneye gathered his surviving legionnaires for a final stand within the walls of Lioneye's Watch.

The theory was that a naked man had nothing to hide, but one might easily venture that Atziri utilised her striking physical presence to influence courtly engagements in her favour.\r\n\r\nA woman like Atziri, beautiful and naked, would be very difficult to refuse. The few statuettes and reliefs that remain depict her as a rare beauty, a young woman with exquisitely delicate features, large, mesmerizing eyes, and a full figure of intoxicating sensuality. Whether the depictions are realist or interpretive is unfortunately impossible to corroborate.\r\n\r\nBut who was the woman behind the title? The few surviving accounts on this matter contain two schools of thought on the matter. Some speak of Atziri with adoration, touting her as a visionary, the woman who would lead the Vaal into a brighter future. Others are less kind, suggesting that Atziri's love for herself overshadowed any love for her people. If her court of mirrors truly existed, however, then the latter seems more likely. Vanity, after all, is the most insidious of all Sins. \r\n\r\nOnly one thing can be said for certain of Atziri: she was the last Queen of the Vaal.

Were this the only unusual attribute of an otherwise uneventful life, Zerphi might have have been cast into the back corner of history to gather dust with the other inexplicable anomalies. But his life was anything but uneventful. \r\n\r\nZerphi was the Vaal civilisation's most infamous serial killer. Over a period of 128 years, Zerphi abducted, tortured and murdered thirteen victims. All in their twentieth year of life. All of noble descent. All Gemlings. But this feat alone did not catapult Zerphi into the annals of history. Rather, it was the quality of his heinous acts that set him apart, not the quantity.\r\n\r\nEvidently, Zerphi was a master at inflicting the most prolonged and agonising demise. His victims' bodies were found in a state of horrific mutilation, yet post-mortem analysis revealed that all of the physical trauma infilcted had occurred while the victim was still alive. Some sources claim that the techniques of torture were so refined that he was able to inflict the most intense and lasting pain the human body is capable of sustaining.\r\n\r\nThen we come to the curious matter of Zerphi's death which, as so often occurs with historical investigation, brings us back to where we started. Zerphi was finally found at the side of his thirteenth and final victim, who was unmolested and unmutilated. Simply dead. When the centenarian's body was committed to autopsy, the recorded results are mystifying in the extreme. It is claimed that Zerphi did not possess the body of a 168-year-old, rather that his corpse had the physiognomy of a man of twenty years, no more.\r\n\r\nLife and Death have walked hand in hand since the beginning of Time.

Afterwards, their literary culture blossomed, along with just about every other aspect of their fledgling civilisation. From the moment the first Vaalish embassadors set foot upon the rugged slopes of the Azmerian Ranges, the Vaal civilisation held the hand of the Azmeri as they grew from a primitive tribal existence into a cohesive culture of settlement and agriculture.\r\n\r\nYet while the Vaal were generous with their knowledge and guidance in many areas, there is one subject upon which they were notably silent: the Tears of Maji, now known as Virtue Gems. Despite an exhaustive search, neither account nor passing reference can be found regarding gem usage amongst the early Azmeri. Though they described the Vaal as having flesh adorned with glittering crystals, our Azmerian ancestors were never privy to the gems' potentials or powers. \r\n\r\nAt least, not until the first Vaal refugees came knocking five hundred years later.\r\n\r\n<i>{ -Trinian - Intellectus Prime}",

The entries were vague about the gender of her prey.\r\n\r\nAfter satiating her carnal desires, she would then quench her divine thirst, draining her erstwhile lover of all bodily fluid.

She was a devotee of Arakaali and according to the literature, had a deep fascination with mortality and the inert human form.\r\n\r\nThe histories tell how the queen would request her subjects to deposit the bodies of their deceased loved ones upon the steps of her palace.

So Tukohama and Valako took him with them on Tukohama's mighty canoe. \r\n\r\nBut while they fished, Kitava grew hungry and secretly ate all of their bait of grubs and worms. Disgusted and angry, Tukohama and Valako decided to use Kitava as bait instead. Valako used his own jawbone as a hook, impaled Kitava on it, and cast both into the sea.\r\n\r\nKitava sank to the bottom of the sea, but instead of the fish eating Kitava, it was Kitava who ate all of the fish that nibbled at him, flesh, scales, guts and all. \r\n\r\nWhen Tukohama and Valako hauled a fat-bellied Kitava back up from the sea, they were even more furious, and knew that Kitava must be punished one final time.\r\n\r\nNarrated by Slave Utula \r\nTranscribed by Irwen of Theopolis"

To Kitava, each strand was a searing lash, and so he wore thousands and thousands of blistering lashes across his back as Hinekora drove him relentlessly into the darkest corner of the underworld. There she left him to suffer, without water or food, for the rest of eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd there Kitava remained, in the darkness of Hinekora's night-clad island for time beyond measure. There he suffered, waiting for the day that he could return to the world of light to slake his scorching thirst and satiate his ravening hunger.\r\n\r\nNarrated by Slave Utula \r\nTranscribed by Irwen of Theopolis"

Some time ago, I was commissioned in the repairing of a strange device delivered into my hands. A golden machine found broken in the ruins of Wraeclast. Believing it to contain some dark infernal secret, the High Templar asked that I restore it and weaponize whatever powers it might contain.\r\n\r\nThough I saw it as mostly inconsequential at the time, it is worth noting, my daughter, a quiet young thing of five, suffered nightmares and tantrums unlike any I'd seen, during those former weeks I spent working on the device. I'd assumed that she missed her mother and was going through a rough patch grieving. Now, however, I can't help but wonder if perhaps it was a sign.\r\n\r\nI'd considered refusing Venarius, though not in any serious nature.

The blade dropped from Venarius' quivering hand and clattered to the ground, a white light in the hilt flickered and shrank until it at last was put out by the great darkness of a tentacular void.\r\n\r\nRealizing what it meant to look upon its face, I turned and shielded my daughter's eyes, and as the true scope of the Elder befell the High Templar and his men. I could hear screaming and mad gibbering! The Elder did not speak. Visions no longer left its mind. It was free. It had no need to communicate with mankind any longer.\r\n\r\nAs the richness of life fled from the quickly shrivelling bodies of the High Templar and his men, I readied myself and my daughter to flee.

But there are others who claim the temple to be the birthplace of technology - even our own is said to pale in comparison to what was being forged within those walls.\r\n\r\nScholars today have even suggested that it was the treasure house for Queen Atziri herself.

If anyone can decipher the dark design afflicting the creatures of Wraeclast, it's him. I've been looking for the source of all this, an equation or overall pattern, but he's unknowingly taken an empirical approach. By learning about and understanding every single corrupted animal - and the energies their blood contains - he's done more to advance our understanding of the problem than I could ever have done myself.\r\n\r\nOne day, he may even solve the symptoms of Corruption without ever understanding the root cause.

My conviction reached a certainty so strong that, if a colleague told me about an expedition they had in mind, and if the sought after artefact was one of sufficient mythological renown, I would bet a month's pay that it would not be found at its supposed resting place.\r\n\r\nI never lost those bets, and now I know I was right, even though I didn't know the name of my theorized secret organisation of relic keepers until now.

None were allowed to speak it openly, but they knew. I didn't find out what kind of society I was truly a part of until I saw Piety's aspirations. I studied the Vaal.

Factions would form. \r\n\r\nOriath didn't learn from Sarn's mistakes, but they cannot be blamed. The death of a ruler always has and always will throw an empire's direction into the wind.\r\n\r\nWith an Eternal Queen, this is a problem we will never have to face. \r\n"

If Drox brought back two boars from a hunt, he needed to bring back three. In battle, he had to deal the flashiest and most devastating blows, and he had to make sure we all saw him do it.\r\n\r\nHis fixation on honing his skills was actually quite useful during our campaign against the Elder, so at the time we thought nothing of it, but... It hollowed him out in some fundamental way. He was full of bravado, yet at the same time desperately afraid of being exposed as merely second or third best. He was never unkind to me, even as the madness crept upon him, but for capable warriors like Drox that threatened his self-image... A clash was inevitable. We slipped away in the dead of night, but I doubt we've escaped a man of his talents. He's out there, lurking and watching, waiting for the best time to strike..."

Today, Drox brought back two. Tomorrow I'll bring back three. Show that loud idiot that I'm the top hunter.\r\n\r\nI know Zana can sense the tension between Drox and myself. I don't think she knows that I can sense the tension between her and Sirus. I've seen her making eyes at him. I've seen him making eyes at her too. I don't think either one of them knows the other is interested. \r\n\r\nI thought Veritania was flirting with me, as she spoke with a smile for once, but I just had boar blood on my lip and it looked like a red moustache. After I wiped it off she went back to reading. \r\n\r\nShut up Baran. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.\r\n\r\nI forfeit. He wins. I'm going to bed."

Now that those purposes are gone, these lands have reverted to a primordial malleable clay which seems to offer up our very desires as offering and appeasement.\r\n\r\nLong ago, before I was exiled, indeed before I truly knew the uncouth adult realities of humanity, I wandered a hall of mirrors at a carnival in Theopolis. By flickering torchlight, I saw myself reflected into infinity, finally obscured not by any horizon, but by the darkening and shrinking of my own image as it grew more and more distant behind echoes of itself.\r\n\r\nThe mists of the Atlas are the same. There is no fog, no humidity, no obscuring and coiling haze. There is only my will, my thoughts, and my expectations, reflected as countless echoes through a vast and immeasurable space.

Drox believes he can forge a new land here, with himself as king. His pride draws him ever further from me.

An evil older than time itself roamed these lands feeding on the memories of Valdo Caeserius, a son of Oriath. \r\n\r\nAlas, the fiend that fed upon him was powerful beyond measure, and unerring in its desire to spread what we discovered was known as the 'Decay.' I know not how long we pursued the demon. Long enough that my allies began to show signs of madness. We'd surely have fallen to the evil were it not for Sirus' courageous leadership... and his sacrifice. \r\n\r\nWe could find no way to slay the demon, though we tried countless times. It was the daughter of Valdo who found a way to seal it, though it cost poor Zana her father, rest his soul. Our gambit would have failed were it not for Sirus. The demon would not give in, clawing its way from Zana's device. Sirus... He leapt onto it. We saw the demon tap into his body, at last relinquishing its grip. Sirus and the demon spiraled into the trap and out of our reality. Both gone. \r\n\r\nThen Sirus was there once more. None of us witnessed his return. His eyes did not move, he did not blink, and his mutterings... Mad and unceasing. Then his face contorted in ways I'd seen only from men possessed by the black spirit. He struck at us again and again. We could not restrain him. We had to flee that place. That is when we discovered our path home was sealed. Valdo's daughter had sabotaged our return. \r\n\r\nI do not know how long we have been trapped here. Weeks, at least. Possibly years. Time in the Atlas is a mirage. \r\n\r\nPlease, dear reader, if you have an ounce of sense in your body, do not dwell here. Return to Oriath, or wherever it is you are from. Tell of Sirus' heroism and sacrifice, and leave him, and us, to die with the secrets we uncovered.\r\n\r\nBaran, the Faithless"

I could not hear God's whispers with such constant noise.\r\n\r\nI dare not visit him now. I want only to escape this prison and punish that insolent blasphemer, Caeserius, for her foolishness. Then, perhaps, I will return here with an army, and take the Atlas. What better show of faith is there than the establishment of a nation in God's name? And then? Whatever God whispers. \r\n\r\nHe has shown me a door. The stones. The paths they reveal. I need only find the right key. \r\n\r\nGod almighty, I am your servant. I am your sword.

Yet we succeeded. We defeated the Elder. Though we couldn't save--... we still succeeded. \r\n\r\nI thought we were done, but... but my companions just kept... returning. Over and over again, they would enter the Atlas, wiping clean entire worlds. It wasn't about saving Oriath, or discovery, it was just... killing. \r\n\r\nThe Atlas does strange things to one's thought processes. I thought at first the madness was a symptom of the Elder, but now... it's the Atlas itself. I'm sure of it. \r\n\r\nBut these exiles are now so strong...

When we sealed the demon, some of my father's memories were expelled, along with those of the Elder's countless other victims. They were muddled together, completely unparsable.\r\n\r\nThese stones are what's left of the Elder's victims from across aeons. Crystallised and concentrated, and drawing the latent energies of the Atlas towards them. To hold one is to hold countless lives in your hand, to fill your mind with a maddening mix of sounds and images and emotions. \r\n\r\nI don't know if Baran knew what he had, but I think he knew what it did.

Excuse me if you know the tale, but I find a well-informed thief is a better thief. \r\n\r\nA few hundred years ago, Kaom, a Karui king of note, landed on the shores of Wraeclast and began an ill-fated conquest north. He won a decisive battle against the Eternals with the help of his niece, Hyrri. She and many other women took up bows and ambushed General Lioneye when hubris got the better of him. It was an ingenious workaround of a restriction of the Karui Way. \r\n\r\nThe poet Victario was present at the battle and later gifted Hyrri with a signed copy of \"O' Eternal\", one of his works. It now sits in the vault of an Oriathan nobleman. I'd like you to bring it home. It should be a straightforward job."

Leaving a little trail as I go so I can find my way out. Little azurite fuse trail winding its way back to the storehouse. Cost me an arm and a leg, that powder. Anyway, I'm right under where I thought the High Templar's office was. Start piling the powder up right under his fat arse. Planning to blow him back to Innocence. \r\n\r\nWell, I start hearing a hissing noise. And I start seeing the blue light down the end of the tunnel turning an angry red. It's moving towards me quick. And I'm thinking, this is it. This is where it ends for me, but at least I'll blow that high pain in the arse skyward. Then it stops. No hissing. No light. Just a silhouette. Tall as a man ever was. Taller than Tibbs. Don't know how he even got through the storehouse hole. This man... this glorious man! \r\n\r\nPut it down! He shouts. It's not worth the trouble. Come. It's time to go! So I put the bag down, and I start walking over to him. Running even. This man saved my life. I swear to myself I'll follow this Eternal Ideal of a man, this statue, this perfect specimen, as far as he will have me. And as I get close, my eyes adjust. This beautiful man comes into focus. His hand is extended to meet me. I reach out mine. There's an electricity between us. And as my fingers lock into his, he slaps a manacle around my wrist. I'm under arrest for attempted deicide and possession of a dangerous substance. Got me exiled, the pig. Once I got here I just started working for the boss.\r\n\r\nWhat was your question?"

Well, the designs have changed a bit, but the fundamentals are the same. It's a grocery list, except instead of the markets, we're going to an alchemy storehouse I'm not supposed to know exists. And instead of groceries, we're going to collect a number of powders, ichors and minerals I'm running low on. And instead of paying for them, we are going to steal them.

Here I am in this place, before you now, ready.\r\n\r\nWhere I am from, the Plains of Vastiri, the Maraketh hold no pity for the weak or the supposedly useless. The other outcasts found me and raised me, and though our lives are harsh, we have a meager culture of our own. We call ourselves the Faridun. The Maraketh believe we are worthless and flawed, but I am convinced I can prove that is not true.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend among my people of a bold warrior who tried to unite the scattered Faridun camps thousands of years ago. His name was Jamanra, and he wished only to unify us so that we might come into our own as a people. If I can prove that he existed by finding the Book of Jamanra, then I may be able to initiate a ritual challenge with the Maraketh to test Faridun warriors for worthiness.

In this land of madness where the dead rise and legendary figures return, I have a reasonable suspicion Jamanra can be found and released from his tomb.\r\n\r\nIf the Maraketh will not listen to our peaceful pleas, then perhaps we Faridun will carve a home for ourselves on the Plains of Vastiri with the sharp edge of a sword. Jamanra can finish what he began thousands of years ago, and if he is empowered by Corruption this time around, then no cowardly poison will be able to stop him.\r\n\r\nHelp me find Jamanra in his tomb and convince him to lead our cause, Exile!"

Right before I got discharged, Enoch was called up to a special unit we'd heard rumours about. A group under the direction of Piety, of all people. Supposedly some elite strike force, but no one personally knew anyone who was a part of it. 'Til Enoch, that is. \r\n\r\nAfter I started working for the Boss, I asked Whakano to find Enoch.

That just don't sit right with me. \r\n\r\nHis records don't list a final resting place, but I know that most blackguards who died on duty were cremated and put to rest in the tunnels beneath the city.

It is indefensible. But, it strikes me that within such a tragedy lies an opportunity. \r\n\r\nThe Theocracy is all but dead, thanks to you, but the military structure, in large part, remains intact. That's a problem. Admiral Darnaw, Innocence save him, is a buffoon. He is such a buffoon, that I would be willing to bet he has documented his buffoonery. Prove me right, and I'll reward you handsomely. And richly! Ha! Do you get it? I was hinting at my natural good looks for humourous effect. Wordplay is so satisfying."

To ensure a true victory and protect our burgeoning towns, we must eliminate whole breeds from existence. We must amputate a piece of nature entirely.

As far as we know, map devices can open portals to almost anywhere, even locations not of this world.

That experience left her very focussed on learning the secrets of the map device, as you can imagine. It was her work that enabled all of this. The Vanguard's foothold on the Atlas.

Twenty years ago, a man named Valdo Caeserius, Zana's father, was trapped in the Atlas by the actions of High Templar Venarius. Zana's father learned some measure of power over the Atlas, and became what we call The Shaper.

Thing is, it didn't fade like usual. The glow remained, and the demons crept about freely, more and more of them as the minutes wore on. Thought I was a goner for sure. Thankfully, I had some sulphite with me. Burned so brightly that a few of the fiends began to recoil, then catalysed an explosion. I was coated in soot and demon-giblets, running for my life. Wouldn't go back there, not even if you paid me. Voltaxic sulphite has saved my life many times over. There's a reason I hold the stuff in such high regard, heh."

K'tash and Ghorr, the other two Demon Lords, are far too unlike us to ever be capable of making a deal with someone like Lycia... or us.

My creations are painfully dim, but to have them is better than enduring the passage of time without change.\r\n\r\nI've lost count of the number of skeletons I've prised apart.

They are simply discarded, thrust away into crypts and buried haphazardly in the earth. The dead are simply... forgotten.\r\n\r\nI wanted to be remembered, so I sought to become what they feared. I sought to live forever. I chased heresy and the unholy power of the demons... I raised the dead, and eventually, cheated death itself. It came at an inexorable cost – and, as fate would have it, I paid with my life. Perhaps there is an irony in this."
