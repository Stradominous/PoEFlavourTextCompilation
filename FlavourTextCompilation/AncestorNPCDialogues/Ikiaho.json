We follow Arohongui with utmost loyalty, but my tribe certainly noticed that she never expressed any divine abilities having to do with light or warmth. When tending wounded warriors, she would often give them visions of beautiful landscapes and shining waters to help calm them. When tending the dying, she gave them visions of their family, until the spirits of their Ancestors truly greeted them here in the Halls of the Dead. These are acts of mercy and kindness, but they are not powers of the Sun or the Moon. I have long suspected that there is something within each of us, some pattern or essence of who we are, that each parent passes down to a child. If my suspicion is correct, then it is not possible that Ramako is Arohongui's father. There is only one sensible conclusion, and that, we keep to ourselves, so as not to disrupt the balance of the skies."

While Lani Hua is indeed absent, it is not to fight against her sister. The wounded souls from that war are sent to the silver palace, where Arohongui tends to them until they may rejoin the fight. Those warrior souls cry out in fear and torment as they lay in hospice. They speak not of war with Sione, but of a war with the stars themselves. They have been sworn to silence by both Sione and Lani Hua, but the feverish ones cannot help but rant. Apparently, the two sisters did go out into the night sky to wage war upon one another, but when they got there, they encountered something horrible, something that drives even the strongest warrior to madness and panic. We have not been abandoned by our two strongest gods. They are out there protecting us every single minute of every single day, and they cannot rest for even a moment. That's what the tales say, in any case. I don't know how much of that I actually believe.   "

I do not know what love is, only that it motivates others to act like fools and monsters, depending on their inclinations. Perhaps I do have a frozen heart, but that doesn't mean I feel nothing. Their words still hurt me, perhaps even more than their weapons."

The Moon, in the sky above, follows a roughly oval path around us. Did you know that our world is actually shaped like the Moon? Most believe that Wraeclast is flat, because that is the obvious interpretation of what we see. However, in studying the Moon, my tribe has discovered the truth. Also, we realised that the Moon's path is not exact. Over many, many thousands of years, it is changing slightly... toward us. We have come to understand that the world will end when the Moon comes too close and falls upon us. This is not myth. This is knowledge. What else could possibly happen when two such titanic spheres of stone crash into each other?"

In life, I followed these questions to the heart of the pattern, and it took me to a vast lake... but I do not remember what I found there..."
