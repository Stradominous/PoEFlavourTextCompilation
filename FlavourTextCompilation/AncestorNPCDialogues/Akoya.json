He helped create the Way, and he set the Ngakuramakoi on the proper path. With the defeat of our god, my tribe will suffer a mark of shame and a spiritual restlessness that I cannot overstate. I understand why you did what you did, and I will try to remain fair to you, but I am not certain I can ever forgive what you've done."

They must be followers of the Way, and they must have passed their test of adulthood, at the Isle of Shrikes or elsewhere. A great warrior does not have to be Karui by blood to become Ngakuramakoi. It is rare, but it does happen. I shall be watching you with great interest."

A cycle of vengeance kept the two groups raiding each other, and they were beginning to lose their superior positions. There was a danger of the other tribes becoming dominant. To put an end to it, Ngamahu and Tukohama went through the traditions together. Tukohama aided her in the forging of a legendary axe, while her ring, a sign of fire and fertility, was given to us. Eventually, her ring passed down to me. Kaom took it, and my head, when he slew me in his bid to unite the tribes. It is our Way, but my defeat still stings."

They have some kind of strength, but I don't know what to make of it, and I certainly don't feel they are passing down any wisdom to their descendants when they speak in riddles. Maybe it's just the particular warriors here? I can't imagine their children talking in prophecies and enigmas."

By dawn's light, we fought on the sand, axe against axe. Kaom was strong, but arrogant, which showed through in his fighting style. When he overextended himself, I made him pay for it in blood. However, his greater strength kept me on the defensive. Every hour, the hatungo called a truce, and we drank, ate, and were tended to. By nightfall, Kaom and I were moving like turtles, guarding ourselves behind our axes and taking only the most calculated movements. Eventually, he overextended again, and I dealt him a heavy wound to his chestbut this was an acceptable sacrifice he had made on purpose. He broke my knee with the end of his axe handle, and that was it. He gave me a warrior's death, rather than leave me broken on the sands. I would not have had it any other way."

Kahuturoa was one of the first souls here, and I fear becoming like him. Right now, after only three centuries or so, I can still take the Way seriously and uphold all of our traditions with pride. What will I be like in thousands of years? With good friends like Ahuana remaining positive, perhaps I can make it to the end with my dignity."

Each tribe has its own belief about how the world will end, but you must understand, these tales do not conflict. They are all correct. Our traditional expectations are not literal. Our hatungo speaks of a time when all Ngakuramakoi will become so strong, and so skilled at warfare, that every man and woman will seek to become their own chieftain. Blood lust will take over the people, and war will continue until only one warrior remains. That warrior will be the strongest that ever lived in all of history, and he will die soon after from his wounds. His fallen body will become the new world, and his blood, the rivers. His dying warcry will become the sky, and his fierce eyes will become the new Sun and Moon. Of course, this is not a literal tale. It is meant to give us a sense of place in a chaotic existence. There is immense value in this. Our traditions give us meaning and purpose, that is why I have dedicated my lifeand my deathto upholding them. Otherwise, we would be adrift, and full of fear."

Even Hinekora seems unwilling to speak on what she sees."
