        "Text": "A traveler was walking through a sparse grove. He encountered Tawhoa, who was sitting and meditating. The traveler quietly joined him for a time, watching a seed fall from above and grow into a mighty oak over the course of a century. That oak dropped its own seed, and another titan grew. Eventually, a vast forest emerged around them. Tawhoa opened his eyes and asked if the traveler understood. He replied that he did, save for one thing: some seeds fell, but never grew at all. At this, Tawhoa looked past him. Hinekora was walking the same path. She picked up each seed that never became more, and carried them, with love, in a bowl formed from her dress. The traveler shed a single tear, for he finally understood."

Fresh-faced, a weapon in hand, facing a savage and untamed land with limitless potential... youth, or something like it, granted to the bold. That is what it means to be alive. The dead will always be here, forever unchanging, locked in a dance we cannot change."

Along the way, they gathered sticks and branches, hoping to feed her flame. Rather than build a bonfire to be encircled by worried eyes, she had them craft torches of their own, and she shared her light. They went out into the darkness unafraid, but now, they could see each other in the distance."

So, she set about making one perfect blade. It took most of her lifetime, but when she was done, she placed it in a clay. The clay became a mold, and from that mold, many perfect blades were forged."

The fish thanked him, and offered to show him the world beneath the waves. The boy accepted, and held on to its fin. They swam through vast coral palaces and thick swarms of iridescent life. The boy looked on with wonder, laughing all the way, until he began to understand how vast the ocean truly was. He could not let go until the journey was complete, but the journey seemed to be without end. The boy no longer smiled, and was forlorn ever after."

He ruminated on it while he held court, and began seeing dark intent in every comment, every dance, and every laugh. Whenever a shadow moved, he jumped. Whenever a friend gripped his arm, he braced for an attack. Eventually, unable to stand the tension any longer, he ordered his guards to slaughter the entire court. The king was left in a bloody throne room, alone and aghast. Without subjects, he was no longer a king. He was merely a madman."

The gull cawed loudly and angrily, and the larger bird dropped the fish. The gull ate well that day. It continued cawing at other birds along the shore, taking what was theirs. Eventually, it saw a great feast laid out near a fire, and it cawed aggressively at the creature beside it. That creature was a Karui woman, far stronger than any bird, and she happily added the gull to her feast.   "

The king suggested that the two sides part ways in peace. The chieftain glowered and said nothing. Finally, the king begged for the chieftain to depart, and offered great wealth in exchange for mercy. The chieftain touched the axe at his side, considering... but then accepted the offer. No warriors died that day, and no songs would be sung of that conflict, but a great victory was still achieved."

He held onto driftwood for a time without end, overcome with sadness. When he finally washed ashore, he staggered to the nearest village. To his surprise, they recognised him, and greeted him with warmth. Looking in the river, he saw that he had a new face. Here, too, he had a home, and a family. Indeed, he had never left at all. It was he who had never known himself."

The farmer believed it would always be so, thus he harvested all that grew within his sight, and gathered it near his home. When the rains withdrew and the land became dry, a stray spark from his hearth burned it all down."
