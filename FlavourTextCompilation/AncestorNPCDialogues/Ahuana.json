I grew up in a time of turmoil and nightmare in the wake of the Cataclysm that destroyed the Eternals. Because she once helped put the men in power who likely caused it, my mother taught me that war is not the glorious endeavour our Way makes it out to be. All she wanted, by the end, was peace. She was begrudgingly taking an army raised from multiple tribes to deal with a strange threat on the edge of Ngamakanui... when she and her legion vanished without a trace.

  "Text": "I died in childbirth, which is considered a warrior's death. I died knowing my daughter would live on. Then, because I was here, I was able to see her grow and thrive. She visited me for advice often, and I treasure those memories. Now, she fights as one of my own in these Halls. Among others, her daughter, and her daughter's daughter, also joined us. We now have dozens of descendants coming to us for wisdom. Life and death are strange partners. I have been here for far longer than I was alive, and my extended family only knows me as an ancestral spirit."

"Id": "The End of Time",
"Text": "The other tribes tell all sorts of stories about the end of time. Those are just fables. You see, the Sun sets somewhere inside the world each night, but it also changes course from season to season. Eventually, it will stray too near, and Wraeclast will be burned away by its heat. However, the Sun brings life as well, so once it returns to the sky, as it always does, there will be a burst of verdancy unlike we have never ever seen. If you think about it, it's the only end that makes sense. "

"Id": "Ramako",
"Text": "Ramako is both the Father of Light, and Father of the Sun. These are not the same duty. In the early days, he was just the Father of Light, and he brought beauty and warmth everywhere he went. The Mother of the Sun, Sione, lived alone in a jade palace in the sky. At that time, the Sun was no brighter than any other star, and it was verdant green. Sione, however, was the most ambitious of the gods. She traded away all of her tribe's possessions to foreign cultures in exchange for gold, and she plated her entire palace with that useless but shiny material. Her tribe was on the verge of starvation, but she asked them to trust her. They put on a festival with what little they had left, and to this, Ramako was invited. In awe of the supposed wealth of Sione, Ramako accepted her invitation to go through the traditions together. Once he entered her golden palace, his light reflected countless times, blazing warmth and life all over the world. Sione's palace cyclically rose above the world, then back into it, and while it was in the sky, that time became known as Day. To her credit, this shining beacon drew food, wealth, and respect to her tribe. Her gambit paid off. Ramako became the Father of the Sun ever after."

"Id": "Rongokurai",
"Text": "Ah, Ramako's brother! During the traditions, when Ramako first joined with Sione, Rongokurai came to the feasts at her palace. This confused the people and the animals, as the sky became dark at strange times when Rongokurai's darkness dimmed the reflecting light of her golden walls. This greatly irritated Sione, but there was nothing she could do. He was family! Her own sister often caused such disruptions already when that silver palace neared hers, and now Ramako's brother would interfere as well. She resolved to hold family gatherings as little as possible. That is why eclipses only happen every few years. The two sisters put aside their eternal war for a brief time to satisfy their traditional familial obligations. Even the gods must follow the Way. "

"NPC": "Ahuana",
"Id": "Lani Hua",
"Text": "Ah... yes... Ramako was impersonated by someone who visited Lani Hua, the Mother of the Moon, in his guise. My ancestors suspected the truth of this immediately. Arohongui had a very strange inheritance, with abilities prone to darkness and illusions, quite unlike Ramako's golden strength and honesty. There is a tale, very rarely told, of a deceiver being caught and locked away for this crime. Supposedly, it was the ancient elders of my tribe that enacted this justice. We consider the matter settled, but Sione and Lani Hua continue to battle for eternity in distant realms... they do not listen to us. They do not listen to anyone. All they care about is vengeance. It might be controversial in Western Ngamakanui, but I say that the gods who forget their people are not owed our loyalty. "
