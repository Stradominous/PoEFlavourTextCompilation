        "Text": "You must be wondering how an old man comes to find himself among these honoured warriors. I practiced a very different type of combat, one that operated in ways that we Karui normally disdain. I was a diplomat, a peacemaker, and an ambassador. In contrast to the warriors around me, I brought unmatched prosperity to my tribe not by raiding or conquest, but through cooperation. I was brought here because it is important that the young and headstrong do not forget the importance of these values. That, and I can crack a skull or two with my cane. So listen when I speak, child! Or you'll get a tap!   "

        "Text": "My fellow Karui never wanted to face the hard truth: if the Vaal wanted to wipe us out, they could have. They wouldn't even have needed to invade us, and our lauded might would have been useless. Their Empire rose to power on the back of Corruption, and those gems the Azmeri called the Tears of Maji. Corruption has a tendency to make Karui sick with a kind of... blood fever. That is the true reason our Way forbids the use of Tears of Maji. During my life, a handful of Karui tried to implant them in their flesh. They became filled with rage and unnatural strength, and we had to put them down... then burn their bodies. Their mere proximity made others sick, too, so for every warrior that transgressed, five others gave their lives to protect the rest of us. To wipe us out, the Vaal could have simply spread the blood fever. My peacemaking, concessions, and treaties were born of that vulnerability, and I am glad I forged such a path. The Vaal Empire eventually succumbed to its own disease, and we remained."

I believe the Karui deserve order, harmony, and peace. You can't live in a beautiful forest if you burn it down. I understand why Utula was given a place here, but I still think it is a step in the wrong direction."

There is personal power, which was best exemplified by Kaom personally besting the leaders of each tribe and uniting the Karui with his own strength. There is communal power, which I try to exemplify. Cooperation and unity produce great works that last for thousands of years. Then, there is faith, which we have yet to fully understand. Somehow, in a bygone era, it turned exceptional men and women into divine beings... I wonder, after all you have done, how many people believe in you?"

You grew into an infant, then a child, then an adult, and one day you will be old... And then, you will die. But in every stage of your life, there were others just beginning theirs. When you die, there will be others just starting their lives. A tree falls, but that only clears the way for new seedlings. Trees die every season, but the forest remains. So it is with the Karui, and, indeed, all peoples. So it is with the world itself. Nothing ever ends, the perspective of existence just... shifts."

It also depends upon the rains brought by Valako, and the coolness brought by Rongokurai. At night, we hunted by the light given by Lani Hua, and then Arohongui, her daughter. As you can see, right from the start, we realised that our existence is inextricably linked with all life... and theirs is linked with ours. Some tribes are too blind or arrogant to see this connection, and we try to pull them back from their excesses, so that we may all thrive."

Hinekora brings our souls here after we die, but where do the souls of other peoples go? Where would we have gone? We assume the alternative is oblivion, but nobody knows for certain. These unanswerable questions plague me at night, when I am trying to sleep."
