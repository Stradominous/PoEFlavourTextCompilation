Can you picture my delight when I awoke here in my prime? I know that I give you lots of, what do they say? Shite? Yes, but I'm just overcome with joy at being young and strong again. No harm meant. Oh, and I'm one of the lucky ones. Here, our souls appear as we truly see ourselves. Some of us had some pretty big surprises when they woke up in the Halls of the Dead! Ha ha!"

It passed down from chieftain to chieftain in my tribe. When I put it on, it did something it never had before: it surged with the power of the storm. Valako didn't know me. How could he? The gods were asleep. So, I appointed myself the Herald of War, and I used the power of Valako's Sign to win many great battles. I laid the foundations for Karui unification before Kaom was even an urge in some bastard's loins."

We Karui are a nomadic people, in the physical and spiritual sense. When I call my tribe the Valako tribe, yes, we are, but at one time we followed Tukohama, and at another Tasalio, and then Valako again before that. Essentially, each god must prove themselves to us the same way we prove ourselves to each other. If a tribe falls on hard times, clearly, their god has failed them, and it may be time for another. We can also call upon any god we wish at any time, so long as we are in good standing as a warrior. Basically, it's like children running amok around the campfire."
