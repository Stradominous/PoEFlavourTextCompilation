How exactly did you fear he would consume the whole world when he could hardly move from his cathedral cradle? Your great victory, 'Godslayer,' is nothing to brag about. We have not needed our gods to be personally present for thousands of years, and we will not be diminished by their loss. We have our own strength."

Wraeclast has only ever been an accursed place that no true Karui should ever step foot on. I wish I had known how tainted it truly was. I would have set fire to it rather than try to claim it. Every empire that has ever arisen there eventually collapsed under the weight of its own disease."

I was certain there would be no dishonour in the eyes of the gods, yet Navali remains cryptic on her absence. She should be here. I am... incensed."

No. The Ngamahu Tribe believes the world will end, not with some pathetic unraveling of the seasons, but with a tremendous eruption. Wraeclast will stab itself and pour forth its lifeblood to burn away all life, both the mighty and the diseased, as it has done before. Then, the first of a new line of Karui will emerge from the molten caldera, as we did before. They will be different. Maybe better, in some sense, having learned from the wisdom our souls will carry forward. Theirs will be a savage new world to conquer all over again. I wish I could be there to see it... a glorious new challenge unlike any other... but my soul will be returned to the volcano with all the others here in the Halls of the Dead, to be melted and reforged into that entirely new Karui essence, that new line. I could wish for no better end."

It is frustrating having to remain here in the Halls of the Dead while the Mother of Fire walks the world in the flesh. I would very much like to meet her. Before I was of age, my father's father allowed me to look upon her sleeping face. It was only then that I understood that there are types of fire unknown to a mere boy."
