Ramako can't stand her, and secretly longs for Lani Hua, the Mother of the Moon, who is kind and caring to all, and very beautiful as well. Ramako goes to our Father of Night, Rongokurai, and asks for the cover of darkness to secretly visit Lani Hua without his wife knowing. Poor Rongo, being a good brother, obliges. Ramako visits Lani Hua many times, until... as happens with such things... Arohongui is born. Sione becomes furious, as you can imagine. The Sun becomes so bright, fire scorches the world...  My tribe survives that fire easily because we tend to live in caves, but Lani Hua, being a natural healer, steps in to preserve the rest of the Karui. Sione goes to war against her, and she and Lani Hua have been fighting ever since. Now, Ramako lives alone in his golden palace, and Arohongui tends wounded souls in the silver palace of the Moon, taking care of it in her mother's absence. The most absurd part? Ramako claims it wasn't him! He calls his brother a liar, and now Ramako and Rongo don't speak. The Day and the Night are forever avoiding each other because the Father of the Sun couldn't keep his belt tied on... fortunately, we Karui are much more mature and responsible in modern times."
