## Introduction
<>< Welcome to the PoE flavour text compilation! ><>

A lot of this data was created through poewiki CargoTable queries.
You can read more on that here: https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Path_of_Exile_Wiki:Data_query_API

You can also find the queries in: https://github.com/Stradominous/PoEFlavourTextCompilation/blob/main/FlavourTextCompilation/PoEWikiQueries.txt

## Information
Here is the data that was fully gathered using the queries:
* Unique Items
* Passives (Atlas and Skill Tree)
* Areas
* Quest Items (Including Heist)
* Heist Objectives
* Prophecies
* Divination Cards
* Map Fragments

Here is the data that was made by formatting existing data into JSON:
* Ancestor NPC Dialogues
* NPC Text Audio March 2023
* Ancestor Equipment Data

Note: Prophecies and Divination Cards do not have Rewards. I am planning on adding those by hand in the near future.

You can find a full compilation of all the data in: https://github.com/Stradominous/PoEFlavourTextCompilation/blob/main/FlavourTextCompilation/Zodiac.json

## Questions / Concerns?
I am planning to keep this data up to date. Probably once a league whenever new dialogue / flavour text is released.

If you have any suggestions or change requests, please reach out to me on Discord. My username is: "stradominous"

## Search Tool
I wrote some fancy tools to generate JSON based on custom searches you want to do.
I used C# because that's what I know and like working with.

You will need Visual Studio 17.8: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-17-8-preview-3-is-here/
And .NET 8.0: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0
