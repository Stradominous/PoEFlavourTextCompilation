# PoE Flavour Text Compilation
Path of Exile Flavour Text Compilation

<>< Welcome to my flavour text compilation! ><>

A lot of this data was created through poewiki CargoTable queries.
You can read more on that here: https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Path_of_Exile_Wiki:Data_query_API
You can also find the queries in: https://github.com/Stradominous/PoEFlavourTextCompilation/blob/main/Flavour%20Text%20Compilation/PoE%20Wiki%20Queries.txt

Here is the data that was fully gathered using the queries:
* Unique Items
* Passives (Atlas and Passive)
* Areas
* Quest Items (Including Heist)
* Prophecies
* Divination Cards
* Map Fragments

Here is the data that was made by formatting existing data into JSON:
* Ancestor NPC Dialogues
* NPC Text Audio March 2023
* Ancestor Equipment Data

If you have any suggestions / requests please message me on Discord. My username is: "stradominous"

I am planning to keep this data up to date. Probably once a league whenever new dialogue / flavour text is released!
